# Marco's Dotfiles

*„Stealing from one person is plagiarism, stealing from many is research.“* – *[John Milton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milton)*

## The Dotfiles

Of course I did not write them all down by myself. Partially, I did that for customization purposes, yet most parts are simple copypasta from other people's dotfiles.

Yes, I know, the '.osx' is not even a dotfile by design.

## Handle with care

As all of the funky stuff is working for me, it might not do the same for you. So, feel free to get all of this over to your computer and use it for good but **pwease** do not come back to me yelling, that *"Those dotfiles destroyed my computer, set fire to the screen and my wife is pregnant now. WTF!"*.

Okay. It might not prove to be that bad but who can be 100% sure?

**Update:** Now that I upgraded (finally) to El Capitan and all is running smoothly, here's the updated `.bash_profile` for that system. Not much changed, you'll see. I sense a few additions in terms of aliases though and I might add `open "https://slack.com/";` to the *meh* task, as we're slowly but surely moving away from Skype as our main chat-app at the office.

**Another Update:** Thanks to Lykathia I now can take the elevator when I want to go to the root directory of any Github project I'm working with. (See the `.bash_profile`)[https://github.com/MarcoHengstenberg/dotfiles/blob/master/.bash_profile].

## What's in this for me

#### `.bash_profile`

To optimize workflows and to make terminal on OSX a wee bit better, I added a lot of aliases. At the very bottom I sourced a `.bash_work` file which is to be kept away from the public because you are a nasty spy trying to get onto other people's servers and mess with things.

Yes, I am looking at you, now, dear reader! **( Ô_o)**

#### `.gitconfig`

This one's pretty obvious. Especially as you are now here, at Github, you might already know what this file does and why it is nice to have it a little bit customized. If not, you might want to take a look inside and figure out what's what and why. A very extensive explanation on customizing your Git-Experience can be found [here](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git).

#### `.osx`

Yes, again, not really a dotfile by definition. Yet I want to keep it here to track my preferred customizations to OSX.

#### `My Homebrew.terminal`

This is just a set of colors thrown at Terminal.app to make it beautiful. *I* like it that way.

#### `Sublime-Text-2`

In this folder you will find my preferences file for Sublime Text 2.

#### `.csslintrc`

For most detailed explanations on what does what and why I'd suggest you may take a look at the [CSSLint Wiki](https://github.com/CSSLint/csslint/wiki). There you will find a wonderfully detailed documentation on the many different features and what's being linted.
